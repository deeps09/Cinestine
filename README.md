Udacity nanaodegree project p2 with material design
As part of the required coursework for the nanodegree i have added many additional features that go well beyond the rubric of the 
project. I have implemented recyclerview to display movies inside cardviews, material design, a details screen with a collapsing toolbar and cardviews to display images.
